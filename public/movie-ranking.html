    <h1>The Best Movies According to Zachary</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a></h3>
    <p>This movie has the most meaning to me. It is my childhood</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095705/">The Naked Gun</a></h3>
    <p>I love silly movies. Movies with the old fashion style of comedy, and this one is perfect.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12758060/">Tetris</a></h3>
    <p>I'm not much of a movie person, but I saw this movie very recently. It was very solid</p>
